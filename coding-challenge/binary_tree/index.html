    <p>var x = 10;</p>
    <p>var nums = [1,2,4,6,10];</p>
    <p>var myObject = {name: 'miles', age: '16'}</p>
    <p>^^^ These are all data structures</p>
    <p>A binary tree is a data structure that is based on the idea of a node. This node can be thought of as the root of the tree. This node [root] will require two child nodes, a 'left' node, and a 'right' node. This acts recursively; the child node will have two children nodes, a 'left' node and a 'right' node. The only time a node won't have a child node, is when it's value is null.</p>
    <p>The algorithm by which we place data in the nodes and subsequent child nodes is like so; compare the value of our item to the value of the node, if it is less than, visit the left node, if it is greater than, visit the right node. If there is no value in the node, place our value. This basic algorithm acts recursively, until we have placed our value, then we start again.</p>
